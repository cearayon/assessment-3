<h2> What's it like?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hot</li>
<li>Dry</li>
<li>Dusty</li>
<li>Conrete Jungle</li>
<li>Lots of sand</li>
<li>I don't like sand. It's all coarse, and rough, and irritating. And it gets everywhere.</li>

<h3>No..but really..</h3>

<p>Phoenix is actually a really cool place to live.If you can survive the heat, you'll love it here. Make sure to drink plenty of water and invest in a humidifier for your place. Outside of the city, there's plenty of nature to enjoy, whether it be the Grand Canyon, Sedona, or just up North. There's never a shortage of lakes to enjoy close to the city. The Salt River is a popular spot to tube at during summer when the snows are melting from the North. The scenery definitely changes with just an hour drive to the north. You'll go from a desertscape to scenery that you'll see in Colorado.</p>

<p>Inside the Phoenix metro, there's plenty to do within downtown and other cities like Tempe and Scottsdale. Nightlife is always bustling in Downtown PHX or Tempe because they're both college towns and everyday, it seems like there's a new restaurant or bar opening in Downtown. There's plenty of shows, concerts, markets, and art walks that popup during the week.
</p>

<p>When it comes to work and career oppportunities, you NEED A CAR. But there's ample to find here with Intel having a mass fabrication plant in Chandler (along with its current expansion), and TSMC setting up on the outskirts of North Phoenix, there's plenty of jobs coming in now and in the future. </p>
    
<p>Cost of living is affordable (compared to other large cities) but it's currently on the rise because of inflation. Phoenix was considered to be the fastest growing city between 2010-2020, with more and more people coming in from other states. This of course will drive prices up regarding rent, property values, and general consumer goods, as demand increases and supply gets smaller for the the first two. </p>
